                    <p id="description">St. Louis, MO is my current home.  I've lived here for the last fourteen, going on fifteen, years.  I moved to St. Louis for college,
                    attending the University of Missouri-St. Louis in 2002 to study international business and management and organizational behavior.  I
                    lived in North County for the first four years and now live downtown, where I've been for the last ten. After graduation, I
                    worked shortly for a corporate property management company before joining College Bound-St. Louis where I worked for eight years running
                    programs that support first-generation, low-income students on their way to attaining their college degrees.  I left earlier last year, ready
                    to take on a new challenge.  I took some time off to recharge my batteries and am now looking for my next opportunity.</p>

                    <p id="description">I lived in Monterrey, Mexico for a semester in my fourth year of college in 2006 as part of a study abroad program, attending Tecnológico´s 
                    de Monterrey.  Tec is located in the heart of downtown Monterrey, a city of 1.2 million people.  While there, I lived off campus with a host
                    family.  My host mom, Maria, housed students from all over Mexico who were attending Tec so it was a great opportunity to get to know them well
                    and be in an immersive environment to learn the Spanish language and Mexican culture.</p>

                    <p id="description">Yakima, WA is my hometown.  I was born and raised in this town in South Central Washington State, just at the foothills of the Cascade Mountains,
                    for the first eight years of my life.  My family relocated to Bridgeport, WV for four years, but we later returned to Yakima, where I stayed until I
                    graudated high school and left for college in St. Louis.  Yakima is a mid-size town of about 80,000 people.  As you can tell from the photo, it's a very
                    beautiful place.  Though a desert, Yakima grows much of the nation's fruit and hops because of irrigation powered by water from the Cascade Mountains. My
                    family owned an orchard for four generations in this valley, growing peaches, apples, pears, and cherries.  I also grew up showing and training horses for
                    eleven years while living there.</p>

                    <h2 id="location-title">Bridgeport, WV</h2>
                    <p id="description">My family relocated to Bridgeport, WV the summer after my second grade school year in 1992.  My father was working as a lead electrical engineer for Bechtel
                    International on the new FBI fingerprint center in Morgantown, WV at the time.  I lived in this community for four years until we returned to Yakima, WA in 1996.
                    Bridgeport was the smallest city I've lived in yet, with only a population of 10,000 people.  Despite it's remoteness, it was a great place to grow up as a kid.
                    I had a lot of friends in the neighborhood to ride bikes and play baseball with during summer evenings and to sled down the steep hills during the winters. As you
                    can see from the photo, one of the best parts of living in this part of the country is the fall foliage.  With nearly an acre-sized backyard, I used to hate having
                    to rake up all of the leaves every year, but while they were still on the trees, they were quite a sight to behold.</p>

                    <p id="description">In 1989, my dad relocated to Moscow, <abbr title="Union of Soviet Socialist Republics">USSR</abbr> to work for Bechtel International as the head electrical engineer for the construction of the new U.S. Embassy.  He lived
                    in the Ukraine Hotel in downtown Moscow for four years.  My mom and I remained in Yakima for most of that time, but did live there for summer between my first and second
                    school year in 1991.  This was the summer just before the coup that overview the government and established what we now today as the government of Russia.  Though I was 
                    young, I have a lot of memories of our time there.  I got to know many of my dad's coworkers and their families and spent quite a bit of time in the community for Bechtel
                    employees, but we also got out and explored the city a lot.  My favorite experience was visiting Red Square and going through the many art pieces sold at the local markets.</p>
